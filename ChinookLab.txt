4 Stored Procedures

5 Transactions
In this section you will be working with transactions. Transactions are usually nested within a stored procedure.

* Task – Create a transaction that given a invoiceId will delete that invoice (There may be constraints that rely on this, find out how to resolve them).

begin;
delete from invoice_lines where id in(
  select A.id from invoice_lines A
    join invoices B on a.invoice_id = b.id
    where b.id = 27 );
delete from invoices where id = 27
commit;

* Task – Create a transaction nested within a stored procedure that inserts a new record in the Customer table


CREATE Function insertCustomer(in int, in varchar(40), in varchar(20), in varchar(80),
         in varchar(70), in varchar(40), in varchar(40), in varchar(40),
         in varchar(10), in varchar(24), in varchar(24), in varchar(60),

    $9, $10, $11, $12,
    $13);
commit;

language sql;


6 Triggers
In this section you will create various kinds of triggers that work when certain DML statements are executed on a table.

6.1 AFTER/FOR

create function log_new_employee() returns trigger as $$
begin
  raise notice 'new employee: %', NEW.id;

end; $$ language plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER new_employee_log_trigger
AFTER INSERT
  ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE PROCEDURE log_new_employee();

* Task – Create an after update trigger on the album table that fires after a row is inserted in the table

CREATE TRIGGER updated_album_log_trigger
AFTER UPDATE
  ON albums
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE PROCEDURE log_update_album();


* Task – Create an after delete trigger on the customer table that fires after a row is deleted from the table.

create function log_delete_customer() returns trigger as $$
begin
  raise notice 'deleted customer: %', NEW.id;
  return NEW;
end; $$ language plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER deleted_customer_log_trigger
AFTER DELETE
  ON customers
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE PROCEDURE log_delete_customer();


7 Joins
In this section you will be working with combing various tables through the use of joins. You will work with outer, inner, right, left, cross, and self joins.

7.1 INNER

Select (a.first_name || ' ' || a.last_name) as customer_name, b.id as invoiceid
From customers a join invoices b on a.id = b.customer_id;


7.2 OUTER
* Task – Create an outer join that joins the customer and invoice table, specifying the CustomerId, firstname, lastname, invoiceId, and total.

select a.id as customerid, a.first_name as firstname, a.last_name as lastname, b.id as invoiceID, b.total
From customers a full outer join invoices b on a.id = b.customer_id;

7.3 RIGHT
* Task – Create a right join that joins album and artist specifying artist name and title.

select a.name, b.title
from artists a right join albums b on a.id = b.artist_id


7.4 CROSS
